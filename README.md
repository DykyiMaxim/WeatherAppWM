# Weatherly

A simple Clean architecture MVVM pet project that get weather information from RestApi "https://open-meteo.com/en" and make weather forecast from device current location. In this app I use default Android Location service and ask for permission to get coordinates, make few requests by Retrofit 2.

For DI i chose Dagger Hilt to inject some dependencies to ViewModel. For  UI, I chose Jatpack Compose and try my best to following the best practices of Clean architecture and keep SOLID principles as well.
